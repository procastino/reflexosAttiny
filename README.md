# reflexosAttiny
What can you do with three leds and a button? This is a very unflexible development board, where you must stretch your imagination to take some utility out of it. It has an attiny, the pushbutton and three leds. I left one pin free and accesible, because I'm a twisted guy with some goodness inside.
The real point of this was learning to design a simple board with KiCad and give some use to a bunch of AtTinys that I had laying around. Now I think it has some interest, for the right kind of people...
## Board
Develped in Kicad 4 (I'll upgrade if I beat my determined lazyness), it is surely not correct from a technical point of view, but it seems to work well.
## BOM
* 1 x AtTiny 85 - 20PU
* 1 x pushbutton 6 mm
* 3 x leds 3 mm
* 3 x 470 ohm resistors (depending on the leds, may need different value)
* 1 x 10Kohm resistor
* 12 right angle male pin headers
* 1 x cr2032 battery holder
* 1 x switch SK12D07V-G3
